# Tree-disequilibrium

This repository mainly stores my master thesis topic **_Global tree distribution disequilibrium dynamics: View of land-use transformation and paleoclimate anomaly_** with the final analysis dataset used in this study. 

Original data source and processed datasets are maintained in a remote computer and may be available upon request to me(pengcheng.lai@qq.com) and [Dr. JM Serra-Diaz](http://serradiaz.info/members/)(pep.serradiaz@agroparistech.fr).
